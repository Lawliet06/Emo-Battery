## Battery Health Tips

- Overcharging can harm the battery's long-term health, so unplug the charger when the battery reaches around 80%.
- Allowing the battery to drain completely can also degrade its lifespan, so plug in the charger when the battery level drops to approximately 40%.
- Avoid letting the battery reach 100% or 0% frequently to maintain optimal battery health and longevity.
